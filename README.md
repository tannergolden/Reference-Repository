# 🎯 About This Repository
The golden-standard template for new projects. It isn’t a product; it’s the playbook for collaboration embedded in code and configuration. From directory layout to documentation, testing, CI/CD, and release conventions, it ensures each repository starts strong, remains maintainable, and ships with confidence. Adopting it reduces inconsistency, shortens ramp-up time, and keeps delivery predictable across teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you create a repository from this template, **edit only this “About This Repository” section** to describe your project. Keep all other sections and documents unchanged so standards remain consistent.

> [!WARNING]
> Never push directly to protected branches (`Development`, `Preview`, `Release`). All changes land via Pull Request (PR) with required checks and approvals.

## 🔎 What this is
A concise specification for our shared **branch model**, **Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD)** gates, and **security posture**—plus links to the practices that keep changes small, tested, and traceable.

- Production-grade template: the same branches, protections, and checks everywhere.
- One place to learn **how we work**: small Pull Requests (PRs), reproducible builds, and written decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> Emoji-named documents are **intentional**. Links below use URL-encoded paths so they render reliably on GitHub.

## 👥 Who this helps
- **New contributors**: get to your **first PR** fast with clear guardrails.
- **Teams**: standardize on **Release / Preview / Development** (optional **Experimental**) with promotion rules.
- **Leads**: keep quality high without slowing delivery.

> [!TIP]
> Share this README with new joiners. It’s the shortest path to understanding how work flows through branches and environments.

## 🧭 How to use
Set this up on day one so every change flows through the same safe path.

1. Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**.  
2. Name the repository and create it under the correct org/account.  
3. GitHub provisions this structure, files, and settings.
4. Edit **only** this **About This Repository** section to describe your project.
5. Create long-lived branches: rename `main` → **`Release`**, add **`Preview`**, **`Development`**; set **`Development`** as default. (Optionally add **`Experimental`** for CI-only spikes.)
6. Protect **`Release`**, **`Preview`**, **`Development`**: require PRs, passing checks (install/lint/test/build), approvals, and signed commits. Run fast tests on **`Experimental`** if you use it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Branch protection relies on **job names** reported by your workflows (e.g., `ci / build-test`). If you rename jobs, update protection rules to match or merges may be blocked.

## 🎛️ Roles & responsibilities
- **Developers** — ship small PRs with tests and clear context; follow branch rules.  
- **Reviewers** — insist on correctness, security, and simplicity; give actionable feedback.  
- **Tech Leads** — tune protections and CI checks; arbitrate trade-offs.  
- **Release Managers** — promote with intent; back-merge to keep lines consistent.

> [!NOTE]
> Use this list as a lightweight review rubric and to set expectations on PRs.

## ✅ Success signals
- PR cycle time **≤ 1–2 days**  
- Protected branches **always green** with required checks  
- Tagged releases and changelogs from **`Release`**  
- **Zero committed secrets**; signed commits on protected branches

> [!TIP]
> Track these metrics in your dashboards to keep the workflow healthy over time.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Why default to `Development`?**  
It’s the safe integration line. **`Release`** stays immutable and is promoted from **`Preview`** after validation.

> [!NOTE]
> As decisions evolve, link relevant Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) here for traceability.

# 📚 Documentation
Start with Introduction to set up your environment and land your first PR. Use Workflow for day-to-day branching, commits, reviews, and CI/CD automation. Check Operations to keep the repo secure, stable, and well-maintained. References provides quick lookups and templates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The links below point to files in /docs/. If you rename or move a file, update every reference across the repo to prevent link drift.

### Introduction
Get set up quickly and understand how this repo is organized and why. This section orients new contributors, aligns everyone on our principles, and ensures your local environment matches what CI expects. By the end, you’ll know the repo layout, standards, and how to make your first safe change.

### Operations
Keep the repository healthy over time. These practices harden security (branch protections, secret handling), reduce supply-chain risk (deps), and maintain repo quality (hygiene, troubleshooting). Use these docs when changing guardrails, rotating secrets, upgrading dependencies, or diagnosing issues in production pipelines.
